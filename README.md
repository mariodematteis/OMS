# Deprecated Order Management System

⚠️ **This project is deprecated and no longer maintained** ⚠️

## Project History

This Order Management System project was initially developed in September 2021. However, due to its poor structure and architectural issues, it has been discontinued.

## Recommendation

For an improved and actively maintained Order Management System, please refer to the **Inkosi** project:

[Inkosi - Order Management System](https://github.com/mariodematteis/inkosi)

Inkosi offers a more robust, well-structured, and feature-rich solution for order management needs.

## Why This Project is Deprecated

1. Poorly structured codebase
2. Lack of scalability
3. Outdated dependencies
4. Limited feature set compared to newer alternatives

## Moving Forward

We encourage all users and potential contributors to explore the Inkosi project, which addresses the limitations of this deprecated system and provides a more comprehensive solution for order management.

Thank you for your interest in this project. We apologize for any inconvenience and hope you find Inkosi suitable for your needs.
